    Author: Vladimir MutiÄ‡
    Version 0.8

    .DESCRIPTION
    Servers should be organized in Restart Groups and script will restart group by group with possibilty to verify status befor proceeding with next group.
    IMPORTANT - CSV file must have CI (computer name) and SEQUENCE (restart group) columns. 
    .PARAMETER CSV (MANDATORY)
    Specify the full source to the CSV file i.e c:\temp\members.csv
    .EXAMPLE
    .\RemoteServerRestart.ps1 -CSV c:\temp\servers.csv
    .PARAMETER UG (OPTIONAL)
    If you specify parameter UG only servers from stated group will be restarted
    .EXAMPLE
    .\RemoteServerRestart.ps1 -CSV c:\temp\servers.csv -UG "DC1"

    .NOTES
    Restart-Computer only work on computers running Windows and requires WinRM and WMI to shutdown a system, including the local system.
    Restart-Computer uses the Win32Shutdown method of the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Win32_OperatingSystem class.

    .DISCLAIMER
    All scripts and other powershell references are offered AS IS with no warranty.
    These script and functions are tested in my environment and it is recommended that you test these scripts in a test environment before using in your production environment.
